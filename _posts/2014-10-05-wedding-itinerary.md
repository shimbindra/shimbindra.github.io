Welcome to [Manz Are Getting Married.com](http://www.manzaregettingmarried.com)!

This should give you the info you need for Shim and Manpreet's big day.

##Dates:
The Wedding Ceremony and Reception is on <b>Sunday May 10th 2015 </B>in Brampton (Greater Toronto Area), Ontario, Canada.

It would be great if you are in Toronto by <b> Tuesday May 5th</b>, so we can party our asses off on Wednesday, Thursday and Friday. 

I will be throwing a Pre-Party before the wedding. The date and location of this is TBD but it will most likely be on <b>Friday May 8th</B> in Downtown Toronto. 



##Who to fly with:

Toronto Pearson Airport is the only airport which handles direct flights from London. The airport is located in between Brampton and Toronto. Here are some of the available airlines:

* <b>Air Transat</b> is normally the cheapest airline and operates from Gatwick direct to Toronto Pearson. I’ve flown with them a few times, they have two types of planes: One type has a personal TV and decent legroom, the other type doesn’t have either.
* <b>Sun Wing</b> (budget airline, I’ve never used them)
* All other standard airlines (<b>Air Canada, BA, America Airlines,</B> etc)


## Where to stay:
Best place to stay for the duration of the trip is in Downtown Toronto.

##Wedding Day – May 10th 2015 (Sunday):
The wedding ceremony and reception will be held in Brampton (a 40 min drive from Downtown Toronto). <br>
Transport will be provided on the Wedding Day for two round trips from Toronto to Brampton for the guests.

Coach plan: <br>

* From Toronto to Brampton before the Gurdwara ceremony (depart 7.30am)
* From Brampton to Toronto after the Gurdwara ceremony (depart 1.00pm)
* From Toronto to Brampton before the reception (depart 5.30pm)
* From Brampton to Toronto after the reception (depart 2.00am)


Weddings in Canada have a different running order compared to UK weddings. Here is an outline of the Wedding Day:

* Sunday AM – Gurdwara ceremony in the morning (same time as UK weddings)
* Sunday AM – After the ceremony there is Langar
* Sunday PM (Early afternoon) - After the Gurdwara is the Doli
* Sunday PM (Early evening around 6/7pm) – Reception
* Monday AM – Reception normally finishes around 2am

Guests have a 6 hour break between the Ceremony and Reception.<br>
During this time you will be taken back to Toronto by the coach. Guests normally wear a different outfit for the reception.
