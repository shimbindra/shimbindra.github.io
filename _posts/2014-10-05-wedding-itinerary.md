#Wedding Schedule

### Pre-party:
* Date: TBD most likely May 8th 2015 (Friday evening)
* Location: TBD most likely Downtown Toronto


###Wedding Day – May 10th 2015 (Sunday):
The wedding ceremony and reception will be held in Brampton (a 40 min drive from Downtown Toronto). <br>
Transport will be provided from my place in Downtown Toronto to the Gurdwara in Brampton.

Weddings in Canada have a different running order compared to UK weddings. Here is an outline of the Wedding Day:

* Sunday AM – Gurdwara ceremony in the morning (same time as UK weddings)
* Sunday AM – After the ceremony there is Langar
* Sunday PM (Early afternoon) - After the Gurdwara is the Doli
* Sunday PM (Early evening around 6/7pm) – Reception
* Monday AM – Reception normally finishes around 2am

Guests have a 6 hour break between the Ceremony and Reception.<br>
During this time guests usually go back to their homes and get ready for the reception. Most guests wear a different outfit for the reception.

Having a hotel in Brampton on Sunday (May 10th) will give you a base and a place to change.



##Who to fly with:
Toronto Pearson Airport is the only airport which handles direct flights from London. It is located in between Brampton and Toronto. Here is an overview of some the available airlines:

* Air Transat is normally the cheapest airline and operates from Gatwick direct to Toronto Pearson. I’ve flown with them a few times, they have two types of planes: One type has a personal TV and decent legroom, the other type doesn’t have either.
* Sun Wing (budget airline and I’ve never used them)
* All other standard airlines (Air Canada, BA, America Airlines etc)

## Where to stay:
Hotel booking:

* Up to and including Saturday (May 9th), I recommend staying in Downtown Toronto
* Book Sunday night (May 10th) in Brampton
* If you are staying in Canada after Monday (May 11th), I recommend going back to Downtown Toronto
