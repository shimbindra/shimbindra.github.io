#Wedding Schedule

### Pre-party:
* Date: TBD most likely May 8th 2015 (Friday evening)
* Location: TBD most likely Downtown Toronto


###Wedding Day – May 10th 2015 (Sunday):
The wedding is in the nearby city of Brampton (which in the Greater Toronto Area). <br>
Transport will be provided from Shim's place in Downtown Toronto to the Gurdwara in Brampton.

Weddings in Canada have a different running order compared to UK weddings. Here is an outline of the Wedding Day:

* Sunday AM – Gurdwara ceremony in the morning (same time as UK weddings)
* Sunday AM – After the ceremony there is Langar
* Sunday PM – Early afternoon - After Gurdwara there is the Doli
* Sunday PM – Early evening (6/7pm) – Reception
* Monday AM – Reception normally finishes around 2am

Guests have a 6 hour break between the Ceremony and Reception.<br>
During this time guests usually go to their homes and get ready for the reception. Most guests wear a different outfit for the reception.

Having a hotel in Brampton on the Sunday, will you give a base and a place to change etc.



### Who to fly with:

* Air Transat are normally the cheapest airline and operate direct from Gatwick to Toronto Pearson. (I’ve flown with them a few times, they have two types of planes: One type has a personal TV and decent legroom, the other type doesn’t have either)
* Sun Wing (budget airline but I’ve never used them)
* All other standard airlines (Air Canada, BA, America Airlines etc)

### Where to stay:
Hotel booking:

* For the beginning part of your trip, please stay in Downtown Toronto up to and including Saturday night
* Book Sunday night (May 10th) in Brampton
* If you are staying in Canada after Monday (May 11th), I recommend going back to Downtown Toronto
